Introduction
------------

I (Joe) wrote the software, and my wife (Kristina) designed the icons.
LICENSE-Code contains the full legalese for the software license.
LICENSE-Icons contains the full legalese for the icon license.

BSD 2-Clause doesn't make sense for the icons.
So, there are separate licenses for the software and for the icons.
